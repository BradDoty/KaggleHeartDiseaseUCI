The blood disorder does not match well to this and there are other indications of a stress test involved in this data (oldpeak, slope and thalach).  I will ask in the Kaggle discussion and otherwise just take it at face value.  thal is not explained on the UCI source site, but other thal variables have to do with an exercise stress test, so let's go with that, NOT the thalassemia.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Sex (Sex)\n",
    "Twice as many men as women.  The total of 303 subjects is considerably under 1000, but big enough to be interesting. Heart disease is more prevalent in men and back in the 1980s when this data was collected, cardiac care infamously focused a lot more attention on male patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (cp) Chest Pain (ChestPain)\n",
    "If we assume that category 4, Asymptomatic, is mapped to value 0 (as an ordinal variable should be), then most of the subjects are not complaining of frequent pain and atypical angina is the most common pain reported.  Otherwise if category 1, Typical Angina, has been mapped to 0, most of the subjects are complaining of typical angina pain, and very few do not have chest pain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (trestbps) Resting Blood Pressure (SystolicBP)\n",
    "I've learned something here https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12698068/.  The better predictor of heart disease is not the bottom (diastolic or rest phase) number as I've always heard, but the top number (systolic), when the heart is pushing its hardest.  That's why we only have 1 number and it's between 90 and 200 with a normal or lognormal shape and a larger tail to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (chol) Cholestorol (Chol)\n",
    "No LDL or HDL measurements.  They probably were not as common in 1988 as they are now.  Normal distribution around 225 with a tail to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (fbs) Fasting Blood Glucose (Glucose)\n",
    "They did not record the number, just a boolean, whether it's over 120.  Today's standards say normal is below 100, pre-diabetes is 100 to 125 and diabetes is 126 or above.  Looks like about 1/6th or 17% of the participants have diabetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (restecg) Resting Electrocardiogram (RestECG)\n",
    "This is an ordinal with 3 values.  Looks like just less than half have normal ECGs. A slightly higher number have ST abnormalities in their ECG and a few have left ventricular hypotrophy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (thalach) Maximum Heart Rate Achieved on Stress Test (STMaxRate)\n",
    "This numeric variable has a lognormal distribution with a peak around 165.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (exang) Exercise-Induced Angina Pain (STPain)\n",
    "One-third reported angina pain from the stress test.  Two-thirds did not.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (oldpeak) ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest  (STWave)\n",
    "This is an odd bird.  The description lists 4 categories for this variable.  They don't even look like they are ordered.  Yet the data are floats with active values in the tenths place and the range goes up to 6.  Not sure what this means, but I'll analyze the data as reported.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (slope) Peak Exercise ST Segment Slope (STSlope)\n",
    "Three arguably ordinal values.  Close to half have a downward slope, a little less are flat and less than 10% have upward slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (ca) Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (NumColor)\n",
    "This is an integer variable, not categorical, showing how many cardiac vessels show a strong color under fluoroscopy.  Despite the description stating there are 4 integer values, from 0 to 3, the data show a range of 0 to 4.  About 60% show zero vessels colored.  20% show 1, 15% show 2, less than 10% 3 and a few cases show 4 vessels colored.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (thal) Thalium Stress Test  (Normal, Fixed Defect, or Reversible Defect)\n",
    "Another odd bird, see the discussion above in Column Descriptions.  The Kaggle description stipulates 3 values (3, 6, 7) and the data show 4 values (0, 1, 2, 3).  Very few zero values, perhaps it is unmeasured or unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (target)  Angiographic Disease Status (AngioTgt)\n",
    "A boolean representing 0. Less than 50% diameter narrowing or 1. More than 50% diameter narrowing, as measured by angiogram."
